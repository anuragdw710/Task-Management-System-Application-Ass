## Description 

Develop a Task Management System Application using the latest version of Angular. This application should be designed to enhance productivity and organization, providing a user-friendly interface for managing tasks.

* Here are the specific requirements for this project:
* A user-friendly interface where users can add new tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority level (low, medium, high).
Users should be able to update the status of tasks (to-do, in progress, completed) and also edit or delete tasks.
The application should display tasks in a list view, with the ability to sort tasks by due date, priority, or status.
The application should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Implement a feature to export the tasks to a CSV file.
There should be a history log showing all the changes made to each task (like when it was created, status changes, edits, etc.)
* Development requirements:
* The application must be created using the latest version of Angular.
You must implement state management via an ngrx store.
For data persistence, you can use local storage.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
